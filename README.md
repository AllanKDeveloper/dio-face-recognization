# Face Detection and Recognition System  

This project focuses on utilizing the libraries and frameworks studied and analyzed during our classes to implement a face detection and recognition system. The primary objective is to integrate the TensorFlow framework with additional libraries as necessary to achieve high-performance, real-time face detection and recognition.  

## Key Features  
- **Multi-Face Detection**: Detects multiple faces simultaneously.  
- **Face Recognition**: Classifies detected faces using a trained classification network.  

## Implementation Details  
1. **Face Detection**:  
   Utilizes a pre-trained detection network to accurately identify facial regions in an image or video stream.  

2. **Face Classification**:  
   Applies a classification network to recognize the detected faces.  

## Expected Output  
The model should accurately detect and classify multiple faces, as illustrated in Figure 1 (example visualization).
